# IoTActivities

In this repository is stored the code of the server and the client coded in python. We used the socket library. This library is already in the python packages and it only needs to ve imported in the python codes.
We used the host 127.0.0.1 and the port 1111 to make the connection between the server and the client. With a message function called send, we asked for an input and then we send the message, the message is received in the client and then a response is writed. 
The response is sended and then evaluated, if the message is bye, the cicle is broken and the script is finished, other way, the exchange of messages keep going until a the messagge received is bye.
