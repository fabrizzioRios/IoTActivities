# Client and Server with C

Branch that contains the client and server scripts in C language.

## Compiling C archives 

To check if both C archives are compiled we are going to run a command in linux

    gcc server.c
    gcc client.c

If bot are compiled correctly, we can proceed to run the archives to make the connection and the communication

    ./server.c
    ./client.c
